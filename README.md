# Screw

There are always some files you'd like to reuse could not become part of a library, e.g. index.html.
There are always some source code you copy and paste from project to project, e.g. a blog controller.
With Screw, you can brew a new project with these treasure you created without pulling them in.
Simply declare it as the base, bundle it, and then it works.
